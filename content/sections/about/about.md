I’m passionate about building things for the web. I started my journey as a developer when I was a kid.

Back when internet access was not easily available in Ethiopia, I used to go to internet cafes and spend hours watching videos on how the web worked, and once internet prices went down and became easily accessible, I was completely hooked to the world of computers.

In the years, I’ve cultivated my passion for coding by studying software engineering at AASTU, but most of all by building personal projects using JavaScript that would impress my friends.

Lately, I’ve discovered my passion for the world of web development and the beauty behind building useful websites like the ones you will find in this portfolio. I’m now looking for a junior developer position to finally kick-start my career and learn among professionals.
